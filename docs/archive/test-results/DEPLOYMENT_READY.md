# BMN Protocol - DEPLOYMENT READY

## Critical Security Fixes Completed (Hours 1-8)

### [FIXED] Resolver Validation Bug
**Previous Issue:** CrossChainEscrowFactory accepted ALL resolvers without validation
**Fix Applied:** 
- Implemented whitelist mapping in CrossChainEscrowFactory
- Added onlyWhitelistedResolverAddress modifier
- Validates resolvers in both _postInteraction and createDstEscrow
- Owner starts as first whitelisted resolver

### [IMPLEMENTED] Emergency Pause Mechanism
- Added `emergencyPaused` state variable
- Added `whenNotPaused` modifier to critical functions
- Added pause() and unpause() functions (owner only)
- Protocol can be immediately halted if issues detected

### [CREATED] Simplified Factory for Quick Deployment
- SimplifiedEscrowFactory.sol - minimal secure implementation
- Removes complex dependencies
- Focus on core functionality
- Ready for immediate deployment

## Deployment Scripts Ready

### 1. QuickDeploy.s.sol
- Streamlined deployment for Base, Optimism, Etherlink
- Auto-configures based on chain ID
- Saves deployment info to JSON
- Ready to use immediately

### 2. TestBMNProtocol.s.sol
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Tests resolver validation
- Tests emergency pause
- Tests escrow creation
- Provides clear pass/fail results

## Deployment Commands

### Deploy to Base Mainnet
```bash
source .env && forge script script/QuickDeploy.s.sol \
    --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --etherscan-api-key $BASESCAN_API_KEY
```

### Deploy to Optimism Mainnet
```bash
source .env && forge script script/QuickDeploy.s.sol \
    --rpc-url $OPTIMISM_RPC_URL \
    --broadcast \
    --verify \
    --etherscan-api-key $OPTIMISM_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

### Test Deployment
```bash
source .env && forge script script/TestBMNProtocol.s.sol \
    --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
    --broadcast
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Immediate Actions (First Hour)
1. [ ] Verify all contracts on Etherscan/Basescan
2. [ ] Add production resolver addresses
3. [ ] Test with 0.001 ETH transaction
4. [ ] Monitor events for proper emission
5. [ ] Verify pause mechanism works

### First Day
1. [ ] Complete 5 test swaps with team wallets
2. [ ] Monitor gas usage
3. [ ] Check for any revert reasons
4. [ ] Document any issues found
5. [ ] Prepare emergency pause if needed

### First Week
1. [ ] Gradually increase test amounts
2. [ ] Add more whitelisted resolvers
3. [ ] Test cross-chain swaps (Base <-> Optimism)
4. [ ] Monitor for MEV attacks
5. [ ] Gather performance metrics

## Security Configurations

### Whitelisted Addresses (Initial)
- Deployer: `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` (UPDATE WITH REAL ADDRESS)
- Test Resolver: `0x3C44CdDdB6a900fa2b585dd299e03d12FA4293BC` (UPDATE WITH REAL ADDRESS)

### Rescue Delays
- Production: 7 days
- Testing: 1 hour

### Timestamp Tolerance
- 5 minutes (300 seconds) for cross-chain drift

## Contract Addresses

### BMN Token (All Chains)
`0x8287CD2aC7E227D9D927F998EB600a0683a832A1`

### Factory Addresses
Will be populated after deployment:
- Base: `[PENDING]`
- Optimism: `[PENDING]`
- Etherlink: `[PENDING]`

## Risk Mitigation

### Start Small
- First transaction: 0.001 ETH
- Second day: 0.01 ETH
- First week: 0.1 ETH max
- Gradual increase based on success

### Emergency Response
1. Call pause() immediately if issues detected
2. Investigate root cause
3. Deploy fix if needed
4. Unpause only after thorough testing

### Monitoring Required
- Watch SrcEscrowCreated events
- Watch DstEscrowCreated events
- Monitor resolver performance
- Track gas costs
- Check for failed transactions

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
- Basic resolver whitelist (no staking yet)
- No circuit breakers (planned for v2)
- No MEV protection (use private mempools)
- Manual resolver management
- No automated monitoring

### Planned Improvements (Week 2+)
- Implement resolver staking
- Add circuit breakers
- Deploy monitoring dashboard
- Add MEV protection
- Implement fee mechanism

## Success Criteria

### Day 1 Success
- [ ] Factory deployed to at least one mainnet
- [ ] At least one successful test swap
- [ ] No critical errors
- [ ] Pause mechanism tested

### Week 1 Success
- [ ] 10+ successful swaps
- [ ] No security incidents
- [ ] Gas costs reasonable (<$50 per swap)
- [ ] 2+ chains operational

## Contact for Issues

- Technical Issues: Review code in `/contracts/`
- Deployment Issues: Check `/script/` folder
- Security Concerns: PAUSE IMMEDIATELY, then investigate

## Final Notes

**REMEMBER:**
1. This is v1 - start with minimal amounts
2. Security > Features
3. Test everything twice
4. Have pause ready at all times
5. Document every transaction

**The protocol is NOW READY for careful mainnet deployment with proper precautions.**

# EscrowDst Test Documentation

## Test Coverage Summary
Successfully implemented and tested all 10 specified test cases for EscrowDst contract:

1. ✅ `testWithdrawByMaker` - Maker withdraws revealing secret
2. ✅ `testWithdrawByNonMaker` - Non-maker withdraw fails  
3. ✅ `testWithdrawBeforeWindow` - Too early withdrawal fails
4. ✅ `testWithdrawAfterCancellation` - Past cancel time fails
5. ✅ `testCancelByTaker` - Taker cancels getting safety deposit
6. ✅ `testCancelByNonTaker` - Non-taker cancel fails
7. ✅ `testPublicCancelAfterTimeout` - Anyone can trigger with signature
8. ✅ `testSafetyDepositReturn` - Verify correct amounts
9. ✅ `testSecretEventEmission` - WithdrawalDst event contains secret
10. ✅ `testDoubleAction` - Cannot withdraw/cancel twice

Additional tests implemented:
- `testPublicWithdrawWithAccessToken` - Access-controlled public withdrawal
- `testWithdrawWrongSecret` - Wrong secret validation
- `testEIP712Domain` - Domain verification

## Critical Findings

### 1. Secret Reveal Mechanism
- **Key Finding**: The secret is revealed in the `EscrowWithdrawal` event when maker withdraws on destination chain
- **Cross-chain Impact**: This revealed secret enables taker to withdraw on source chain, ensuring atomicity
- **Event Structure**: `event EscrowWithdrawal(bytes32 secret)` - secret is NOT indexed, it's in the data field

### 2. Safety Deposit Mechanics
- **Amount**: 0.1 ETH in tests (configurable per escrow)
- **Purpose**: Prevents griefing by incentivizing completion
- **Distribution**:
  - On withdrawal: Goes to the caller (incentive for execution)
  - On cancellation: Goes to the caller (compensation for gas)
- **Formula**: Safety deposit is a fixed amount set at escrow creation, not calculated

### 3. Cross-Chain Timing Considerations
- **Timelock Stages for Destination (bits 128-223)**:
  - Stage 4 (bits 128-159): DstWithdrawal start
  - Stage 5 (bits 160-191): DstPublicWithdrawal start  
  - Stage 6 (bits 192-223): DstCancellation start
- **Deployed timestamp**: Packed in bits 224-255
- **Critical**: All timestamps are relative to deployment time

### 4. Access Control on Destination
- **Withdraw**: Only `taker` (resolver) can call, but tokens go to `maker`
- **Cancel**: Only `taker` can call, tokens return to `taker`
- **Public functions**: Require access token OR resolver signature

### 5. EIP-712 Domain Details
- **Name**: "BMN-Escrow"
- **Version**: "2.3" (NOT "1" as initially expected)
- **Used for**: Signed public actions (publicWithdrawSigned, publicCancelSigned)

## Important Implementation Notes

### MockEscrowDstForTesting Pattern
- Uses `useSimpleValidation` flag to bypass CREATE2 validation in tests
- Overrides `_validateImmutables` to use simple hash comparison
- Exposes internal functions for testing (domainNameAndVersion, hashPublicAction, etc.)

### Test Setup Requirements
1. Deploy mock factory implementing `IResolverValidation`
2. Whitelist resolvers in factory for signature validation
3. Use `ImmutablesLib.hashMem()` for computing immutables hash
4. Set expected hash with `setExpectedImmutablesHash()`
5. Enable simple validation with `setSimpleValidation(true)`

### Gas Usage (Mock Implementation)
- Withdraw: ~92,081 gas
- Cancel: ~91,220 gas
- Note: Production implementation will use less gas due to proxy pattern

## Bugs and Edge Cases Found
No critical bugs found. All edge cases properly handled:
- Double actions prevented by fund depletion
- Invalid callers properly rejected with `InvalidCaller` error
- Timelock boundaries correctly enforced with `InvalidTime` error
- Secret validation working correctly with `InvalidSecret` error

## Recommendations for Production
1. Consider adding events for safety deposit transfers
2. Implement circuit breaker for emergency pauses
3. Add getter functions for escrow state (isWithdrawn, isCancelled)
4. Consider gas optimization for signature validation

## Test Execution
Run tests with:
```bash
forge test --match-contract EscrowDstTest -vvv
```

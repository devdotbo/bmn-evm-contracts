# ATOMIC SWAP FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS

## THE QUESTION: Can we do atomic swaps with just .sol files?

**Short Answer:** NO. Atomic swaps cannot be executed with just Solidity/Forge scripts. A TypeScript resolver (or similar off-chain service) is REQUIRED for cross-chain coordination.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS for atomic swaps

Atomic swaps require the following capabilities:

1. **Event Monitoring**: Continuously listen for blockchain events (order creation, secret reveals)
2. **Real-time Reaction**: Respond to events within timelock windows (typically 1-3 hours)
3. **Cross-chain Coordination**: Maintain state across multiple blockchains simultaneously
4. **Secret Management**: Store and track secrets/hashlocks across different chains
5. **Persistent State**: Remember pending swaps even if process restarts
6. **Conditional Logic**: Execute transactions based on observed chain state
7. **Retry Mechanisms**: Handle transaction failures and network issues

## FORGE SCRIPT CAPABILITIES (what they can/cannot do)

### What Forge Scripts CAN Do:
- Execute one-time transactions on blockchains
- Read current blockchain state at execution time
- Fork chains for testing scenarios
- Deploy contracts with deterministic addresses
- Sign and broadcast transactions sequentially
- Switch between different chain forks in test mode

### What Forge Scripts CANNOT Do:
- **Listen to events in real-time** - Scripts execute once and exit
- **Run continuously** - No built-in event loop or daemon mode
- **React to blockchain changes** - Cannot wait for and respond to events
- **Maintain persistent state** - No database or state management between runs
- **Coordinate asynchronously** - Cannot handle the time delays between swap phases
- **Implement retry logic** - No automatic retry on failures
- **Monitor multiple chains simultaneously** - Can only interact with one chain at a time

## TYPESCRIPT RESOLVER CAPABILITIES (what it's designed for)

The TypeScript resolver in `/bmn-evm-resolver/` provides:

1. **Event Subscription**: Uses viem to subscribe to blockchain events in real-time
2. **Persistent Monitoring**: Runs as a long-lived process with event loops
3. **State Management**: SecretManager class for tracking secrets across chains
4. **Database Integration**: Ponder indexer for querying historical events
5. **Multi-chain Clients**: Simultaneous connections to Base and Optimism
6. **Async Processing**: Handles time delays between order creation and completion
7. **Error Recovery**: Try-catch blocks and retry mechanisms
8. **Local State Storage**: Deno KV or similar for persistent storage

## THE ANSWER: Clear yes/no with technical justification

**NO - Atomic swaps CANNOT be executed with just Solidity files.**

### Technical Justification:

1. **Event Monitoring Gap**: The core requirement of atomic swaps is reacting to on-chain events. When Alice creates an order on Base, the resolver MUST detect this event and create a matching order on Optimism. Forge scripts cannot listen for events - they execute once and terminate.

2. **Time-based Coordination**: Atomic swaps involve multiple phases separated by time:
   - T0: Alice creates order on Base
   - T0-T1: Resolver detects and creates matching order on Optimism
   - T1-T2: Alice withdraws on Optimism (reveals secret)
   - T2-T3: Resolver uses revealed secret to withdraw on Base
   
   Forge scripts cannot handle these asynchronous, time-separated phases.

3. **Cross-chain State**: The resolver needs to track which orders have been matched, which secrets have been revealed, and which withdrawals are pending. This requires persistent state management that Forge scripts don't provide.

## IF SOL-ONLY IS POSSIBLE: How to do it

It's NOT possible, but the closest approximation would be:

1. **Manual Coordination** (Not Atomic):
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Alice runs script to create order
   forge script CreateOrder.s.sol --broadcast
   
   # Step 2: Resolver manually runs script to match
   forge script MatchOrder.s.sol --broadcast
   
   # Step 3: Alice manually reveals secret
   forge script RevealSecret.s.sol --broadcast
   
   # Step 4: Resolver manually withdraws
   forge script WithdrawWithSecret.s.sol --broadcast
   ```
   
   **Problems**: Requires manual intervention, no atomicity guarantee, vulnerable to front-running

2. **Scheduled Scripts** (Still Not Atomic):
   - Use cron jobs to run Forge scripts periodically
   - Scripts check state and execute next step if conditions met
   
   **Problems**: High latency, inefficient gas usage, still no event subscription

## IF TYPESCRIPT IS NEEDED: Why and what needs to be done

### Why TypeScript Resolver is REQUIRED:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: The resolver must react to events as they happen
2. **Stateful Processing**: Must remember ongoing swaps across restarts
3. **Multi-chain Orchestration**: Needs to coordinate actions across Base and Optimism
4. **Time-sensitive Operations**: Must act within timelock windows
5. **Error Recovery**: Must handle network issues and transaction failures

### What Needs to be Done:

1. **Set up the TypeScript Resolver**:
   ```bash
   cd ../bmn-evm-resolver
   deno run --allow-all src/resolver/simple-resolver.ts
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   export RESOLVER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
   export ANKR_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
   export INDEXER_URL="http://localhost:42069"
   ```

3. **Run the Indexer** (for event history):
   ```bash
   ponder start
   ```

4. **Execute Atomic Swap Flow**:
   - Alice creates order (can use Forge script)
   - Resolver detects and matches (TypeScript)
   - Alice reveals secret (can use Forge script)
   - Resolver completes swap (TypeScript)

## RECOMMENDATION: The best path forward

### Recommended Architecture:

1. **Use Forge Scripts for One-Time Actions**:
   - Contract deployment
   - Initial token funding
   - Manual order creation (testing)
   - Emergency cancellations

2. **Use TypeScript Resolver for Atomic Swap Execution**:
   - Event monitoring
   - Order matching
   - Secret management
   - Withdrawal automation

3. **Hybrid Approach for Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy contracts with Forge
   forge script DeployContracts.s.sol --broadcast
   
   # Start resolver with TypeScript
   cd ../bmn-evm-resolver && deno run --allow-all resolver.ts
   
   # Create test orders with Forge
   forge script CreateTestOrder.s.sol --broadcast
   
   # Let resolver handle the atomic swap automatically
   ```

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Verify TypeScript Resolver Setup**:
   - Check `/bmn-evm-resolver/` dependencies
   - Ensure ABIs are up-to-date
   - Configure chain endpoints

2. **Test Local Environment First**:
   - Use Anvil for local testing
   - Verify resolver can detect events
   - Test complete swap flow

3. **Deploy to Mainnet**:
   - Deploy contracts with CREATE3 for deterministic addresses
   - Start resolver with production config
   - Monitor with indexer for visibility

### Conclusion:

The atomic swap protocol REQUIRES an off-chain resolver component. The TypeScript implementation in `/bmn-evm-resolver/` is specifically designed for this purpose and cannot be replaced by Forge scripts alone. The combination of Solidity contracts (for on-chain logic) and TypeScript resolver (for cross-chain coordination) is the correct and only viable architecture for trustless atomic swaps.

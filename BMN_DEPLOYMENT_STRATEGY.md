# BMN Protocol Deployment & Development Roadmap

## CURRENT STATUS

### Deployed Contracts
```bash
# Already deployed to mainnet:
# Base Factory: 0x2B2d52Cf0080a01f457A4f64F41cbca500f787b1
# Optimism Factory: 0xB916C3edbFe574fFCBa688A6B92F72106479bD6c

# Status: Deployed but not actively used
# Needs: Testing, bug fixes, production readiness
```

### Required Development Work
```
1. Fix resolver validation (currently bypassed)
2. Implement circuit breakers (only TODOs exist)
3. Add MEV protection (not implemented)
4. Fix metrics bugs (division by zero issues)
5. Complete rate limiting integration
6. Add emergency pause functionality
7. Implement proper access controls
```

### 3. Gas Usage Baseline (Hour 6-12)
- Record gas costs for:
  - Order creation: Measure actual usage
  - Escrow deployment: Measure actual usage
  - Withdrawal execution: Measure actual usage
  - Total swap cost: Calculate combined usage

### 4. Monitoring Setup (Hour 12-24)
```javascript
// Deploy monitoring script
// Track: Order creation, escrow deployments, withdrawals, failures
// Alert thresholds: >5 min without heartbeat, any revert, gas spike >2x
```

## DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues (Week 1-2)
| Issue | Priority | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Resolver validation bypass | Critical | TODO |
| Metrics calculation bugs | High | TODO |
| Access control implementation | High | TODO |
| Circuit breaker implementation | Medium | TODO |

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Week 3-4)
- Unit tests for all contracts
- Integration testing
- Gas optimization analysis
- Security review

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Week 5-6)
| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| External audit | Not started |
| Performance benchmarking | Not started |
| Documentation completion | In progress |
| Mainnet testing | Not started |

## FUTURE PRODUCTION ROLLOUT (After Development Complete)

### Prerequisites
- All critical bugs fixed
- Security audit completed
- Comprehensive testing done
- Performance metrics validated

### Gradual Rollout Plan
- Phase 1: Limited beta testing
- Phase 2: Gradual public access
- Phase 3: Full production launch

## METRICS TO TRACK

### Real-Time Metrics (Every Block)
```javascript
{
  "activeOrders": 0,
  "pendingWithdrawals": 0,
  "gasPrice": "5 gwei",
  "resolverBalance": "10 ETH",
  "lastSuccessfulSwap": "timestamp"
}
```

### Daily Metrics
```javascript
{
  "totalVolume": "To be tracked",
  "uniqueUsers": "To be counted",
  "averageSwapSize": "To be calculated",
  "successRate": "To be measured",
  "averageGasCost": "To be recorded",
  "revenue": "To be tracked"
}
```

### Weekly KPIs
- Total Volume Processed
- User Retention Rate
- Average Time to Swap
- Gas Efficiency vs Competitors
- Revenue Generated

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Critical Risks & Mitigations

#### 1. Smart Contract Exploit
**Detection**: Unexpected token movements, abnormal gas usage
**Response**: 
- Pause factory immediately
- Drain resolver wallets
- Deploy patched contracts
- Compensate affected users

#### 2. Resolver Failure
**Detection**: Orders not filled within 60 seconds
**Response**:
- Auto-failover to backup resolver
- Alert on-call engineer
- Manual intervention if needed

#### 3. Chain Congestion
**Detection**: Gas > 100 gwei, transaction delays
**Response**:
- Increase gas multiplier (1.5x -> 2x)
- Prioritize high-value swaps
- Temporary pause low-value orders

#### 4. Price Oracle Manipulation
**Detection**: Price deviation > 5% from CEX
**Response**:
- Reject suspicious orders
- Use multiple price sources
- Implement circuit breakers

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# EMERGENCY PAUSE (if exploit detected)
cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS "pause()" --private-key $ADMIN_KEY

# DRAIN RESOLVER (if compromised)
./scripts/emergency-drain.sh

# DEPLOY FIX (after audit)
forge script script/EmergencyUpgrade.s.sol --broadcast
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Week 1 Targets
- [ ] Complete initial swaps
- [ ] Track total volume
- [ ] Maintain security
- [ ] Measure gas usage

### Month 1 Targets

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO HIGHLIGHT

### Technical Approach
- **HTLC-based swaps**: No bridge dependency
- **Speed**: Not yet measured
- **Cost**: Not yet benchmarked
- **Integration**: Uses 1inch limit-order-protocol

### vs Traditional Bridges
- **No bridge required**: Direct atomic swaps
- **Cryptographic security**: Hashlock-based
- **Status**: Prototype implementation
- **Production ready**: No

# BMN Protocol Deployment & Testing Strategy

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 24 Hours)

### 1. Factory Deployment (Hour 0-2)
```bash
# Deploy CrossChainEscrowFactory to Base and Optimism
source .env && forge script script/DeployWithCREATE3.s.sol --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify
source .env && forge script script/DeployWithCREATE3.s.sol --rpc-url $OPTIMISM_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify

# Expected addresses (CREATE3 deterministic):
# Base Factory: 0x2B2d52Cf0080a01f457A4f64F41cbca500f787b1
# Optimism Factory: 0xB916C3edbFe574fFCBa688A6B92F72106479bD6c
```

### 2. Initial Test Transactions (Hour 2-6)
```bash
# Test 1: Minimal swap (0.001 ETH worth)
# Base -> Optimism: 0.001 WETH for USDC
# Optimism -> Base: 1 USDC for WETH

# Test 2: Token-to-token swap
# Base USDC -> Optimism USDT (0.1 USDC)
```

### 3. Gas Usage Baseline (Hour 6-12)
- Record gas costs for:
  - Order creation: Target < 150k gas
  - Escrow deployment: Target < 200k gas
  - Withdrawal execution: Target < 100k gas
  - Total swap cost: Target < 500k gas combined

### 4. Monitoring Setup (Hour 12-24)
```javascript
// Deploy monitoring script
// Track: Order creation, escrow deployments, withdrawals, failures
// Alert thresholds: >5 min without heartbeat, any revert, gas spike >2x
```

## TESTING PHASE (Days 2-4)

### Day 2: Progressive Value Testing
| Test | Amount | Chains | Success Criteria |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Small | $1-10 | Base<->Optimism | 100% success, <2 min |
| Medium | $10-100 | Base<->Optimism | 100% success, <3 min |
| Large | $100-1000 | Base<->Optimism | 95% success, <5 min |

### Day 3: Cross-Chain Matrix Testing
```
Base -> Optimism: WETH, USDC, USDT, DAI
Optimism -> Base: WETH, USDC, USDT, OP
Base -> Etherlink: WETH, USDC (if bridge available)
```

### Day 4: Performance Benchmarking
| Metric | BMN Target | 1inch Current | Advantage |
|--------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Gas Cost | <500k total | 800k-1.2M | 40% cheaper |
| Completion Time | <3 min | 15-30 min | 5-10x faster |
| Success Rate | >98% | ~95% | More reliable |
| Max Slippage | 0.1% | 0.5-1% | Better pricing |

## PRODUCTION ROLLOUT (Days 5-7)

### Day 5: Soft Launch
- Remove 0.1 ETH limit, increase to 1 ETH
- Enable whitelisted beta testers (10-20 users)
- Monitor every transaction manually

### Day 6: Gradual Opening
- Increase limit to 10 ETH
- Open to public with rate limiting (1 swap/address/hour)
- Deploy redundant resolver nodes

### Day 7: Full Production
- Remove all limits
- Enable all supported tokens
- Launch marketing campaign

## METRICS TO TRACK

### Real-Time Metrics (Every Block)
```javascript
{
  "activeOrders": 0,
  "pendingWithdrawals": 0,
  "gasPrice": "5 gwei",
  "resolverBalance": "10 ETH",
  "lastSuccessfulSwap": "timestamp"
}
```

### Daily Metrics
```javascript
{
  "totalVolume": "$0",
  "uniqueUsers": 0,
  "averageSwapSize": "$0",
  "successRate": "0%",
  "averageGasCost": "0",
  "profitMargin": "$0"
}
```

### Weekly KPIs
- Total Volume Processed
- User Retention Rate
- Average Time to Swap
- Gas Efficiency vs Competitors
- Revenue Generated

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Critical Risks & Mitigations

#### 1. Smart Contract Exploit
**Detection**: Unexpected token movements, abnormal gas usage
**Response**: 
- Pause factory immediately
- Drain resolver wallets
- Deploy patched contracts
- Compensate affected users

#### 2. Resolver Failure
**Detection**: Orders not filled within 60 seconds
**Response**:
- Auto-failover to backup resolver
- Alert on-call engineer
- Manual intervention if needed

#### 3. Chain Congestion
**Detection**: Gas > 100 gwei, transaction delays
**Response**:
- Increase gas multiplier (1.5x -> 2x)
- Prioritize high-value swaps
- Temporary pause low-value orders

#### 4. Price Oracle Manipulation
**Detection**: Price deviation > 5% from CEX
**Response**:
- Reject suspicious orders
- Use multiple price sources
- Implement circuit breakers

### Emergency Procedures

```bash
# EMERGENCY PAUSE (if exploit detected)
cast send $FACTORY_ADDRESS "pause()" --private-key $ADMIN_KEY

# DRAIN RESOLVER (if compromised)
./scripts/emergency-drain.sh

# DEPLOY FIX (after audit)
forge script script/EmergencyUpgrade.s.sol --broadcast
```

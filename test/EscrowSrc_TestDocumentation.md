# EscrowSrc Test Documentation

## Test Suite Summary
All 17 tests for EscrowSrc contract are passing successfully.

## Test Coverage
The test suite covers all 13 required test cases plus additional comprehensive tests:

### Core Test Cases (13 Required)
1. **testWithdrawValidSecret** ✅ - Taker withdraws with correct secret
2. **testWithdrawInvalidSecret** ✅ - Reverts on wrong secret
3. **testWithdrawBeforeWindow** ✅ - Reverts if too early
4. **testWithdrawAfterWindow** ✅ - Reverts if past cancellation time
5. **testPublicWithdrawDuringPublicWindow** ✅ - Anyone can trigger during public window
6. **testPublicWithdrawNotInWindow** ✅ - Reverts outside public window
7. **testCancelByMaker** ✅ - Taker (not maker!) cancels during cancel window (Note: EscrowSrc uses onlyTaker for cancel)
8. **testCancelByNonMaker** ✅ - Non-taker cancel fails
9. **testPublicCancelAfterTimeout** ✅ - Anyone can cancel after public window
10. **testDoubleWithdraw** ✅ - Cannot withdraw twice
11. **testWithdrawAfterCancel** ✅ - Cannot withdraw after cancellation
12. **testEIP712SignedWithdraw** ✅ - Resolver-signed withdrawal
13. **testEIP712SignedCancel** ✅ - Resolver-signed cancellation

### Additional Tests
14. **testExactTimelockBoundaries** - Tests exact timelock boundaries (off by 1 second)
15. **testWithdrawToCustomTarget** - Tests withdrawTo function with custom target
16. **testGasMeasurements** - Comprehensive gas measurements
17. **testImmutables** - Validates test environment setup

## Key Implementation Details

### Mock Architecture
- **MockEscrowSrcForTesting**: Extended EscrowSrc with simple validation mode for testing
- **MockFactory**: Implements IResolverValidation for EIP-712 tests
- Uses `useSimpleValidation` flag to bypass CREATE2 validation during tests

### Timelock Structure
Timelocks are packed in a uint256 with:
- Bits 224-255: Deployment timestamp (32 bits)
- Bits 0-31: SrcWithdrawal offset (Stage 0)
- Bits 32-63: SrcPublicWithdrawal offset (Stage 1)
- Bits 64-95: SrcCancellation offset (Stage 2)
- Bits 96-127: SrcPublicCancellation offset (Stage 3)

Test values:
- SrcWithdrawal: +100 seconds from deployment
- SrcPublicWithdrawal: +200 seconds
- SrcCancellation: +300 seconds
- SrcPublicCancellation: +400 seconds

### Secret Validation
- Correct secret: `keccak256("correct_secret")`
- Hashlock: `keccak256(abi.encode(CORRECT_SECRET))`
- Invalid secret properly reverts with `InvalidSecret` error

### Gas Measurements (Mock Implementation)
```
Withdraw: ~99,127 gas
Cancel: ~36,935 gas
Public Withdraw: ~65,993 gas
```
Note: Production implementation will have lower gas costs (~31k for withdraw, ~42k for rescue per original specs)

### EIP-712 Implementation
- Domain name: "BMN-Escrow"
- Version: "1"
- Actions: "SRC_PUBLIC_WITHDRAW", "SRC_PUBLIC_CANCEL"
- Resolver signature verification through factory's `isWhitelistedResolver`
- Test uses known private key (0x12345678) for deterministic signatures

## Important Discoveries

### Access Control
1. **Cancel Permission**: In EscrowSrc, `cancel()` uses `onlyTaker` modifier, not `onlyMaker`
   - This is intentional: on source chain, taker has permission to cancel
   - Maker already has their tokens, taker needs ability to cancel if secret not revealed

2. **Public Functions**: Require access token OR resolver signature
   - Access token check via `onlyAccessTokenHolder` modifier
   - Signed versions use `_requireValidResolverSig` for validation

### State Transitions
- All state changes are one-way (no reentrancy possible)
- Token transfer failure prevents state change
- Safety deposit always goes to msg.sender (incentive for public actions)

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Exact Boundary Testing**: Timelock boundaries tested to exact second
2. **Double Operations**: Prevented by token balance depletion
3. **Invalid Immutables**: Properly caught by validation
4. **Zero Balances**: Transfers fail gracefully

## Test Environment Setup
```solidity
// Accounts
MAKER: 0x5678
TAKER: 0x9ABC
RESOLVER: Derived from private key 0x12345678
ANYONE: 0x1111

// Tokens
Test Token: 1000 ether in escrow
Safety Deposit: 0.1 ether in escrow
Access Token: For public function access
```

## Potential Improvements for Production
1. Consider adding events for failed attempts (for monitoring)
2. Add circuit breaker for emergency pause
3. Consider gas optimization for validation checks
4. Add more granular error messages for debugging

## Running the Tests
```bash
# Run all EscrowSrc tests
forge test --match-contract EscrowSrcTest -vvv

# Run specific test
forge test --match-test testWithdrawValidSecret -vvv

# With gas reporting
forge test --match-contract EscrowSrcTest --gas-report
```

## Next Steps for Agent
- Review EscrowDst contract for similar test coverage
- Consider integration tests with factory deployment
- Test cross-chain scenarios with mock bridges
- Validate against production deployment parameters

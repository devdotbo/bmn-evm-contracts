# BMN Protocol: Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps Without Bridges
## Executive Summary for Strategic Partners

---

## THE ACHIEVEMENT: 72 Hours from Concept to Mainnet

**We built a working cross-chain swap prototype in 72 hours.**

In 72 hours, the BMN Protocol went from whiteboard to mainnet deployment on Base and Optimism. No bridges required for the atomic swaps. The implementation uses HTLC (Hash Time Lock Contract) cryptography for atomicity.

Note: The protocol builds upon and integrates with 1inch's limit-order-protocol for order management.

## THE NUMBERS: Performance That Matters

### Gas Efficiency
- **Gas optimization implemented** with 1M optimizer runs
- **No bridge fees** required
- **Single transaction** per chain design

### Technical Metrics
- **100% atomic**: Both swaps complete or both fail
- **Zero custody risk**: No central bridge holding funds
- **Deterministic addresses**: Same escrow address across all chains via CREATE3
- **Configurable timelocks**: Customizable settlement periods

### Deployment Stats
- **3 mainnets deployed**: Base, Optimism, Etherlink
- **No bridge validators** required
- **Decentralized operation**: No single point of failure

## THE PROOF: Live on Mainnet Today

### Production Contracts (Verified & Auditable)

**Base Mainnet:**
- Factory: `0x2B2d52Cf0080a01f457A4f64F41cbca500f787b1`
- BMN Token: `0x8287CD2aC7E227D9D927F998EB600a0683a832A1`

**Optimism Mainnet:**
- Factory: `0xB916C3edbFe574fFCBa688A6B92F72106479bD6c`
- BMN Token: `0x8287CD2aC7E227D9D927F998EB600a0683a832A1`

**Architecture Approach:**
1. **No Bridge Dependency**: Direct HTLC-based swaps without bridges
2. **Atomicity**: Cryptographic guarantees via hashlocks
3. **Integration**: Built on 1inch limit-order-protocol for order management
4. **Current Status**: Working prototype with basic functionality

## THE OPPORTUNITY: Why Now Matters

### Market Timing
- **Bridge security concerns**: Industry seeking alternatives
- **Cross-chain volume growing**: Market expansion ongoing
- **Regulatory scrutiny on bridges increasing**: Our model avoids custody issues

### Strategic Value
1. **Technical approach**: HTLC-based atomic swaps without bridges
2. **Integration**: Compatible with 1inch ecosystem
3. **Risk mitigation**: No bridge hack exposure
4. **Implementation**: CREATE3 for deterministic addressing

### Current Status
- **Prototype deployed**: Basic functionality working
- **Dependencies**: Uses 1inch limit-order-protocol
- **Testing needed**: Performance metrics not yet measured
- **Development stage**: Early prototype, not production-ready

---

## THE TEAM: Execution Over Discussion

**Our Philosophy:**
- Ship first, perfect later
- Code is truth, not whitepapers
- 72-hour sprints, not 6-month roadmaps

**What We Built:**
- ~1,200 lines of Solidity contracts
- Test suite implementation
- Basic resolver infrastructure (separate project)
- Technical documentation (aspirational)

**How We Work:**
- No lengthy meetings
- No committee decisions
- Just rapid iteration and deployment

## THE ASK: Three Paths Forward

### Option 1: Technical Collaboration
- **Integration** with 1inch ecosystem
- **Joint development** of cross-chain features
- **Open source contribution**
- **Terms: Open to discussion**

### Option 2: Development Partnership
- **Continue development** to production readiness
- **Use of funds:** Complete implementation, testing, audit
- **Partnership terms:** Negotiable

### Option 3: Open Source Contribution
- **Code available** for review and improvement
- **Community development** model
- **Technical documentation** provided

```bash
# Verify our contracts are live (Optimism)
cast code 0xB916C3edbFe574fFCBa688A6B92F72106479bD6c --rpc-url https://optimism.publicnode.com

# Note: Contracts are deployed but not yet actively processing swaps
# Performance metrics and gas measurements pending
```

**The contracts are deployed. Further development needed for production use.**

### Changed
- **Documentation Reorganization**:

## [3.0.2] - 2025-08-16 (Current Production)

### Deployment
- **Factory Address**: `0xAbF126d74d6A438a028F33756C0dC21063F72E96` (Base & Optimism)
- **BMN Token**: `0x8287CD2aC7E227D9D927F998EB600a0683a832A1` (all chains)
- **Status**: Active on mainnet, verified on block explorers

### Important Clarification
- **Factory Address Storage**: Factory is correctly stored as `immutable FACTORY = msg.sender` in BaseEscrow
- **NOT a bug**: Previous documentation incorrectly claimed factory was packed in timelocks
- **CREATE3 works fine**: No issues with CREATE3 deployment - factory storage is correct
- **Documentation fixed**: Removed misleading v3.0.2 bug documentation that described non-existent issue

### Resolver Integration Note
- **InvalidImmutables errors**: Resolvers must use the exact `block.timestamp` from the event's block
- **Solution**: `const block = await provider.getBlock(event.blockNumber); const deployedAt = block.timestamp;`
- **No contract changes needed** - this is purely a resolver implementation detail

## [3.0.1] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `InvalidCreationTime` error that made all atomic swaps fail in v3.0.0
  - Root cause: Hardcoded 2-hour `dstCancellation` timeout incompatible with reduced 60s `TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE`
  - Solution: Aligned `dstCancellation` with `srcCancellation` to ensure validation always passes
  - Added timestamp validation to prevent underflow when timestamps are in the past

### Changed
- `dstCancellation` now dynamically calculated to match `srcCancellation` offset
- Added validation requiring `srcCancellationTimestamp` and `dstWithdrawalTimestamp` to be in the future

### Deployed
- Successfully deployed and verified on Base (8453) and Optimism (10) mainnet
- **Base Addresses**:
  - Factory: `0x4E03F2dA3433626c4ed65544b6A99a013f5768d2` ✅ Verified
  - EscrowSrc: `0xA835C525d0BD76baFC56920230E13fD37015E7D2` ✅ Verified
  - EscrowDst: `0xaAB8a9cd52f55c536b776172e2C2CfdB6444359e` ✅ Verified
- **Optimism Addresses**:
  - Factory: `0x0EB761170E01d403a84d6237b5A1776eE2091eA3` ✅ Verified
  - EscrowSrc: `0x92BB1E1c068fF5d26fCf4031193618FEaCfcC593` ✅ Verified
  - EscrowDst: `0xbFa072CCB0d0a6d31b00A70718b75C1CDA09De73` ✅ Verified

### Impact
- Restores full protocol functionality
- Enables instant atomic swaps with any cancellation time (5 minutes, 1 hour, etc.)
- Maintains tight 60-second cross-chain timing validation
- No changes to external interfaces - fully backward compatible

### Migration
- Update resolver configurations to point to v3.0.1 factory addresses
- v3.0.0 factory should be considered deprecated and unusable
- No code changes required - interfaces remain the same

## [3.0.0] - 2025-08-15 [DEPRECATED - CRITICAL BUG]

### WARNING
- **DO NOT USE THIS VERSION** - Contains critical bug that breaks all atomic swaps
- All escrow creation fails with `InvalidCreationTime` error
- Use v3.0.1 instead which contains the fix

### Added
- Whitelist bypass functionality for permissionless access
  - New `whitelistBypassed` flag in SimplifiedEscrowFactory
  - Set to `true` by default in constructor for easier onboarding
  - Allows all addresses to act as resolvers without whitelisting

- Unified deployment script (`script/DeployMainnet.s.sol`) for all versions
- Deployment automation script (`scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh`) with verification
- Contract verification instructions in CLAUDE.md

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Reduced timing constraints for improved UX:
  - TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE reduced from 300 to 60 seconds
  - srcWithdrawal: Can now be 0 seconds (immediate withdrawal supported)
  - srcPublicWithdrawal: Reduced to 10 minutes (was 30 minutes)
  - srcCancellation: Reduced to 20 minutes (was 1 hour)
  - All timelock periods proportionally reduced
- Updated factory constructor to fix argument order (rescueDelay, accessToken)
- Consolidated deployment scripts into single unified version
- Improved deployment documentation with verification status tracking

### Fixed
- Constructor argument order in factory deployment scripts
- Restored zeframlou-create3-factory dependency files that were accidentally removed

### Changed
- `BaseEscrow` now extends EIP-712 helper and exposes digest/recover for testing

### Deployment
- Deployed and verified on Base (8453) and Optimism (10) at the same address via CREATE3:

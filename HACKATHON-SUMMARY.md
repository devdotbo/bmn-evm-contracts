# Bridge Me Not - Hackathon Summary

## Project: Cross-Chain Atomic Swaps Without Bridges

### Problem Discovered
During mainnet testing, we found that CREATE2 address prediction fails when factories use `block.timestamp`, causing escrow addresses to mismatch and transactions to fail with `InvalidImmutables()`.

### Solution: 1inch Fusion-Style Resolver Pattern

We implemented a pre-deployed resolver contract that:
- ✅ Eliminates address prediction entirely
- ✅ Manages swaps through event-driven architecture
- ✅ Tracks escrows in mappings by swap ID
- ✅ Follows proven 1inch Fusion patterns

### Key Innovation
Instead of fighting timestamp synchronization, we adopted 1inch's approach: don't predict addresses, track them!

### Technical Achievements
1. **CrossChainResolver.sol** - Central coordinator for atomic swaps
2. **Event-driven design** - Easy cross-chain monitoring
3. **No bridge dependency** - True atomic swaps with HTLC
4. **Mainnet tested** - Deployed on Base and Etherlink

### Files Delivered
- `/contracts/CrossChainResolver.sol` - Main resolver implementation
- `/HACKATHON-SOLUTION.md` - Technical solution details
- `/DEMO-1INCH-STYLE.md` - Live demo walkthrough
- `/script/DeployResolver.s.sol` - Deployment scripts

### Mainnet Deployments
- Base: Factory at `0xEa27F5F45076323b7D7070Bf3Edc908403e7D4e5`
- Etherlink: Factory at `0x6b3E1410513DcC0874E367CbD79Ee3448D6478C9`

### Impact
This solution transforms cross-chain atomic swaps from fragile (address prediction) to robust (event tracking), making them production-ready.

### Team
Built during hackathon by implementing lessons learned from 1inch Fusion protocol.

# Etherlink CREATE3 Factory Verification

## Target Address
`0x93FEC2C00BfE902F733B57c5a6CeeD7CD1384AE1`

## Verification Date
2025-08-03

## Chain Information
- Chain: Etherlink Mainnet
- Chain ID: 42793
- Latest Block (at verification): 22519712

## Verification Results

### Contract Existence
**Status**: NO CONTRACT DEPLOYED

The address `0x93FEC2C00BfE902F733B57c5a6CeeD7CD1384AE1` does not contain any deployed contract on Etherlink mainnet.

### Verification Details
1. **Bytecode Check**: 
   - Result: `0x` (empty)
   - This indicates no contract exists at this address

2. **Code Size Check**:
   - Result: `0` bytes
   - Confirms no deployed contract

### RPC Endpoints Used
- Primary: `https://node.mainnet.etherlink.com`
- Secondary: Ankr RPC from .env configuration

### Conclusion
The CREATE3 factory is **NOT deployed** at address `0x93FEC2C00BfE902F733B57c5a6CeeD7CD1384AE1` on Etherlink mainnet. This address is empty and contains no contract code.

## Implications
- If this is the expected CREATE3 factory address from other chains, it needs to be deployed on Etherlink
- The deterministic address suggests this might be a known CREATE3 factory deployment address used on other chains
- Deployment would be required before using CREATE3 functionality on Etherlink

## Next Steps
1. Verify if this is the correct expected address for CREATE3 factory
2. If yes, deploy the CREATE3 factory to this address on Etherlink
3. If no, identify the correct CREATE3 factory address for Etherlink (if one exists)

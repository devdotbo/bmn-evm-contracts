## Successful Transaction

### Transaction Details

- **From**: Alice (`0x240E2588e35FB9D3D60B283B45108a49972FFFd8`)
- **To**: Alice (self-transfer for proof of concept)
- **Amount**: 1 BMN token (1e18 wei)
- **Chain**: Base Mainnet
- **Transaction Hash**: `0xc955e16725492a6e756c1115ebfcad9792a2a5f1a8d5effb07bef68b90a0ce2e`

### Transaction Verification
```bash
# Verify transaction on Base Explorer

```

## Factory Interaction Attempts

### Whitelist Resolver Attempt
- **Function Called**: `addResolverToWhitelist(address)`
- **Transaction Hash**: `0x8c60ce0f9375a833060c6b84f0154e95d65bf04811d090d0df8f3685be9ad9e5`
- **Status**: FAILED (Status 0)
- **Gas Used**: 22,080
- **Issue**: Transaction reverted despite correct owner calling
- **Potential Cause**: Contract may have additional validation logic or security features

### Direct Escrow Deployment Attempt
- **Function Called**: `deployEscrowSrc()`
- **Status**: FAILED (Simulation)
- **Issue**: Reverted during simulation
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. Resolver not whitelisted (confirmed: false)
  2. Additional validation requirements not met
  3. Factory may require specific order structure from limit order protocol

## Key Findings

### Positive Results
1. ✅ All accounts are functional with proper key access
2. ✅ Accounts have significant BMN token balances
3. ✅ Successfully executed ERC20 transfer on mainnet
4. ✅ Confirmed factory contracts are deployed and active
5. ✅ Verified contract ownership matches deployer account

### Challenges Identified
1. ⚠️ Low ETH balances limit transaction capacity
2. ⚠️ Factory whitelist function appears to have additional validation
3. ⚠️ Direct escrow deployment requires further investigation
4. ⚠️ May need to interact through limit order protocol interface

## Gas Cost Analysis

### Current ETH Balances vs Requirements
- **Available ETH**: 
  - Deployer: 0.008 ETH
  - Alice: 0.004 ETH
  - Resolver: 0.005 ETH
- **Simple Transfer Cost**: ~0.0000003 ETH
- **Contract Interaction Cost**: ~0.00009 ETH (failed whitelist)
- **Estimated Swap Cost**: ~0.001-0.002 ETH

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Debug Factory Contract**: Analyze why whitelist function fails despite correct owner
2. **Check Additional Requirements**: Factory may have additional security features or requirements
3. **Fund Accounts**: Add small amounts of ETH (0.01-0.02) to enable more complex operations

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Use Limit Order Protocol**: Interact through the intended interface
2. **Deploy Simplified Factory**: Create a minimal factory for testing
3. **Direct Implementation Usage**: Deploy escrows using implementation contracts directly
4. **Contact Protocol Team**: Verify if there are additional setup requirements

## Proof of Account Control

The successful BMN token transfer proves:
1. We have full control of the private keys
2. The accounts are properly funded with tokens
3. The blockchain infrastructure is accessible
4. Transaction signing and broadcasting works correctly

## Technical Infrastructure Verified

✅ RPC Endpoints: Public Base and Optimism RPCs functional
✅ Forge Scripts: Successfully compile and execute
✅ Account Access: Private keys properly loaded from environment
✅ Token Contracts: BMN token transfers work as expected
✅ Gas Estimation: Accurate for simple operations

## Conclusion

We have successfully proven the ability to execute real mainnet transactions with the BMN Protocol funded accounts. While the full cross-chain swap couldn't be completed due to factory validation requirements, we have:

1. Confirmed all account balances and access
2. Executed a real token transfer on Base mainnet
3. Identified the specific challenges with factory interaction
4. Documented clear next steps for resolution

The main blocker is understanding the factory's validation logic for resolver whitelisting, which appears to have additional requirements beyond simple ownership verification.
